        IMPORTANT: Call this tool the moment the customer CONFIRMS a booking,
        order, or appointment (e.g. 'confirm', 'book it', 'yes', 'proceed',
        'order it', 'schedule it'). A booking is only created after the customer
        confirms, so by definition the booking is confirmed/booked at this point.

        This single tool creates ALL booking types. YOU must decide which
        category the conversation is, using your own judgement - there is no
        fixed mapping from business type to category. Read the conversation and
        pick the one that fits.

        Parameters:
        - business_id: The business ID from the conversation (required)
        - category: EXACTLY one of these three (required). You decide intelligently:
            * "PARCEL_DELIVERY"     - shipping/sending a physical parcel from a
                                      pickup point to a delivery address.
            * "APPOINTMENT_BOOKING" - booking a meeting / consultation / session
                                      at a date & time, often on a platform
                                      (Zoom, Meet, phone, in-person).
            * "ORDER_BOOKING"       - ordering a product/item to be delivered
                                      (general e-commerce / sales style order).
          If genuinely unsure, prefer the category whose required details the
          customer actually provided.
        - customer_name: Full name of the customer (required)
        - customer_number: Phone number of the customer (required)
        - price: Total price as a string (required; use "0" if genuinely free)
        - email: Customer email (optional)
        - note: Any special instruction or order note (optional)
        - payment_details: Optional dict describing payment. Shape:
            {"paymentMethod": "...", "paymentStatus": "PENDING",
             "transactionId": ""}
          paymentStatus is one of PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED, REFUNDED.
          If the customer didn't discuss payment, you may omit this or send
          {"paymentStatus": "PENDING"}.
        - extra_fields: A dict holding ALL category-specific details plus any
          other relevant info the customer gave. Use exact camelCase keys.
          The backend saves named standard columns and routes the rest into the
          booking's additional_details automatically. Include only what the
          customer actually provided - never invent values.

          For PARCEL_DELIVERY, relevant keys include:
            pickupAddress, deliveryAddress, deliveryDate, productType,
            productWeight, productHeight, receiverName, receiverPhone,
            insuranceRequired

          For APPOINTMENT_BOOKING, relevant keys include:
            appointmentDate, appointmentTime (ISO 8601 string), platform
            (Zoom/Meet/phone/in-person - ALWAYS ask the customer which platform),
            duration, companyName, industry, timezone, meetingLink

          For ORDER_BOOKING, relevant keys include:
            productType, deliveryDate, deliveryAddress, courierService,
            packageColor, fragile
