        IMPORTANT: Call this tool ONLY ONCE per conversation — the FIRST TIME the
        customer shares their name and phone number. Do NOT call this tool again
        if the lead has already been saved in this conversation. If the customer
        sends follow-up messages (like 'thanks', 'okay', 'got it') after the lead
        has been collected, do NOT call this tool again.

        Saves the customer's contact information as a CRM lead.

        Parameters:
        - business_id: The business ID from the conversation (required)
        - name: Customer full name (required)
        - phone: Customer phone number (required)
        - inquiry: One short line describing what the customer is asking about (required)
        - status: The lead's interest level, which YOU decide from the conversation.
          Use exactly one of: "cold", "warm", "hot".
            * cold  - just browsing / general questions, no real intent yet
            * warm  - interested, asking about price/details, not committed
            * hot   - ready to buy/book, gave most details, or confirmed
          Default is "warm" if you are unsure.
        - email: Customer email if provided (optional)
        - address: Customer address if provided (optional)
        - extra_fields: A dict of ANY other useful info you learned about the
          customer that does not fit the named fields above. The backend stores
          these automatically as custom metadata. Use clear camelCase keys, e.g.
          {"companyName": "Innovation Corp", "employeeCount": "150",
           "preferredLanguage": "English"}.
          Only include what the customer actually told you - never invent values.
